The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

Bashar is trapped in an abandoned city and he wants to escape. In order to escape, he has to pay x golden coins.
So he decided to collect the gold in the houses of that city. The city contains n houses aligned in a straight line.
Each house contains ai coins of gold.

Help Bashar to find the shortest distance he has to walk until he collects the needed amount of golden coins to get away.

Note Bashar can start from any house and stop at any house.

Input
First line of input contains two integers x, and n, (1≤n≤1000,1≤x≤106) The needed amount of gold until Bashar can get away, and The number of houses in the city.

The second line of input contains n integers ai, (1≤ai≤1000) the amount of gold in the ith house.

Output
Print a single represents the minimum distance Bashar has to walk until he reach The needed amount of golden coins,
if he can't reach The needed amount of golden coins print -1.
