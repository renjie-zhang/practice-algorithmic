/**
In this Kata, you will be given a number n (n > 0) and your task will be to return the smallest square number N (N > 0)
such that n + N is also a perfect square. If there is no answer, return -1 (nil in Clojure, Nothing in Haskell).
More examples in test cases.
Good luck.
Please don't forget to rate this kata.
